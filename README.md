This is the code that I developed to scrape my Delivery History from Uber's website. I have no doubt that it can be iterated and improved upon. This was my attempt to simplify the process and automate as much as I could with my current skills.

The example I give is a folder titled **uber_webscape** which can be found at this path:
**‘/Users/yourname/uber_webscrape/’**

### Step 1:

Now that we have our file set up, click the Folder titled **Step 1** and run the code **1_login**
