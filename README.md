This is the code that I developed to scrape my Delivery History from Uber's website. I have no doubt that it can be iterated and improved upon. This was my attempt to simplify the process and automate as much as I could with my current skills.

### Instructions:

Before we begin, you'll need to create a folder that will be used exclusively for this project. We will be referencing it throughout.

The example I give is a folder titled **uber_webscape** which can be found at this path:
**‘/Users/yourname/uber_webscrape/’**

### Step 1:

Now that we have our file set up, click the Folder titled **Step 1** and run the code **1_login**

You will need to replace the snippet of text that says _Enter the Phone Number Associated with your Account Here_ with a valid phone number. Digits only, no dashes. (See Line 20)

This should prompt a verification process, which will need to be completed manually.

Your screen should now look something like this: <img width="797" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 12 37 26 PM" src="https://github.com/ThatOneGuy1821/Scraping-Your-Uber-Driver-Data/assets/142834049/d7fda5a2-b52c-41e3-964a-0e1e12e2616e">
